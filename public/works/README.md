# Portfolio Images

Place your portfolio website screenshots in this folder.

## Required Images:
- `structa-claims.jpg` - Screenshot of Structa Claims website
- `bread-bloom.jpg` - Screenshot of Bread Bloom website
- `newstead-plant-co.jpg` - Screenshot of Newstead Plant Co website

## Image Guidelines:
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Dimensions:** 800x600px or larger (landscape orientation)
- **Quality:** High resolution, clear screenshot of the website homepage
- **File size:** Optimize to under 500KB for fast loading

## How to Get Screenshots:
1. Visit each website URL
2. Take a full-page screenshot or capture the hero section
3. Crop/resize to focus on the best part of the design
4. Save with the exact filename listed above
5. Place in this folder

## Temporary Solution:
The component will show gradient backgrounds if images are missing, so the site works without them.
